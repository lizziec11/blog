This week has been very busy 
Too many work to do with so little time. 
I don't know how to combine code school homework 
and tons of other assignments on my worksheet with learning new things 
I'm honestly burning out and wating for the program to end. 
I have a lot of things to learn even with the help of others, 
I'm not sure if I'm ready to start doing stuff with what I have learnt so far 
I will keep learning to get better even after I'm done with the program.
I just want to get better every week. 
I hope next week will be better.
