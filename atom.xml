    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week has been very busy
Too many work to do with so little time.
I don&rsquo;t know how to combine code school homework
and tons of other assignments on my worksheet with learning new things
I&rsquo;m honestly burning out and wating for the program to end.
I have a lot of things to learn even with the help of others,
I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m ready to start doing stuff with what I have learnt so far
I will keep learning to get better even after I&rsquo;m done with the program.
I just want to get better every week.
I hope next week will be better.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 2 to me was hard, but I think I&rsquo;m starting to learn something. I&rsquo;m just happy that I&rsquo;m not as lost as i was the first day I started. The JS online book helped a lot. So far I&rsquo;m happy with this YWEBCA.I will try read more of the online book to get my stuff done. Things are hard because I am just learning the language of coding. The book is helping me a little bit but I still need extra help. I&rsquo;m happy to be a part of the program and I hope next week will be better. Week 3 here come!!</p>
