    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week has been very busy
Too many work to do with so little time.
I don&rsquo;t know how to combine code school homework
and tons of other assignments on my worksheet with learning new things
I&rsquo;m honestly burning out and wating for the program to end.
I have a lot of things to learn even with the help of others,
I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m ready to start doing stuff with what I have learnt so far
I will keep learning to get better even after I&rsquo;m done with the program.
I just want to get better every week.
I hope next week will be better.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just like the other week, I have learned a lot but there is so much to learn. The time is short, a lot of work to do.
I don&rsquo;t think I understand everything I need to know at this point, all I&rsquo;m trying to do at this moment is keep learning.
I hope to improve on the little I&rsquo;ve figured out.
I&rsquo;ll still get assistance from anybody in the program who is willing to help out.
My goal is to make sure I become really fluent in the course.
Learning new things is very difficult and I want to be sure that I&rsquo;m  doing the right thing.
I&rsquo;m drained already, I can&rsquo;t keep up with a lot of my classmates and the work we have to do.
I&rsquo;ll make sure I keep working until I can be comfortable to do something with what I&rsquo;ve learn so far.</p>
